OFSP
Orbital Foundation Systems Platform
🛰️ OFSP – Orbital Foundation Systems Platform
Orbital Foundation Systems Platform (OFSP) is a modular, defense-grade cybersecurity and forensic operations framework designed for high-integrity threat detection, memory inspection, and digital countermeasure deployment. Built atop PySide6 and integrated with YARA rule sets, OFSP offers a multithreaded control interface, scan automation, and live system telemetry.

Welcome to the GhostCore Era.
You’re not the NPC.

🌌 Overview
OFSP acts as a launchpad for securing mission-critical infrastructure in orbital, digital, or metaphorically haunted environments. It offers GUI-based control surfaces and backend modules to:

Monitor processes and memory in real-time

Analyze memory regions for shellcode and injection patterns

Manage and enforce YARA rules with whitelist awareness

Trigger threat detection alerts and quarantine responses

Conduct full filesystem scans with forensic filtering

Display diagnostics with admin-elevation awareness

🧩 Key Modules
Module	Purpose
OrbitalStationUI_Complete.py	PySide6 UI for scanning, rule management, process monitoring
ScannerGui.py	Tkinter legacy GUI for simpler deployment or retro mode
Weapons_Systems.py	Malware scanning logic and heuristics using signatures and patterns
YaraRuleManager.py	Rule orchestration, loading, validation, and external repo syncing
shared_constants.py	Windows API constants and ctypes-based memory structures

🛡 Features
⚙️ Quick & Deep Scans (Process, Memory, Filesystem)

🧠 YARA Rule Compilation & Whitelist Handling

⚡ Real-Time Detection Alerts & Event Logging

🚨 Quarantine Capabilities & Threat Isolation

🧬 Shellcode Detection via Pattern Matching

🔧 Admin Check & Privilege Escalation Alerts

🚀 Getting Started
1. Requirements
Python 3.9+

PySide6

psutil

yara-python

Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
2. Run the PySide6 Interface
python OrbitalStationUI_Complete.py
Or launch the Tkinter fallback UI:
python ScannerGui.py
3. YARA Rule Setup
OFSP will automatically initialize rule directories and pull open-source repositories like:

awesome-yara

Neo23x0/signature-base

CAPEv2

You can also drop .yar or .yara files into the yara_rules/custom_rules directory.

💾 Storage & Configuration
Logs: scanner.log

Quarantine folder: quarantine/

Rule directories: yara_rules/

Configuration constants: See shared_constants.py

🧠 Philosophy
This platform isn’t just about protection—it’s about perception. It watches the edge cases. It doesn’t just ask “what’s running?”—it asks why, how long, and what came before.

"Subtle wink."
"Off-camera, but it happened."
"The pen is still in your hand."

⚠️ Legal & Ethical Use
OFSP is for educational, ethical, and red team use only. Do not deploy in unauthorized environments or without consent.
