SQL Injection is a code injection attack where attackers insert malicious SQL statements into input fields. This allows them to:
- Extract sensitive data from the database
- Modify or delete database records
- Potentially execute commands on the database server

**How It Works:**
1. Attacker finds an input field that connects to a database query
2. Instead of normal input, attacker enters: `' OR '1'='1`
3. The SQL query becomes: `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '' OR '1'='1'`
4. Since '1'='1' is always true, all records are returned

**Countermeasures:**
- Use parameterized queries (prepared statements)
- Implement input validation and sanitization
- Apply the principle of least privilege to database accounts
- Use Web Application Firewalls (WAF)
- Implement error handling that doesn't expose database details"""

- Reflected XSS: Malicious code in URL parameters
- DOM-based XSS: JavaScript code manipulates page structure

**Impact:**
- Steal session cookies
- Perform actions on behalf of users
- Deface websites
- Distribute malware

**Prevention:**
- HTML encode all user input
- Use Content Security Policy (CSP) headers
